Project Name: HIT! 
By: Syed Hussain, Raghav Vamaraju


CONNECTION INSTRUCTIONS:

To use play our game (HIT!), you must have the joystick, pushbutton, and potentiometer connected to the Arduino.

Our pin connections are as follows:

Joystick HORZ   ->  0
Joystick VERT   ->  1
Joystick SEL    ->  9
Pushbutton      ->  4
Potentiometer   ->  2
Screen CARD_CS  ->  5   --|
Screen TFT_CS   ->  6     |
Screen D/C      ->  7     | 
Screen RESET    ->  8     |  -->  Same connections as in the Assignments and Exercises.
Screen MISO     ->  50    |
Screen MOSI     ->  51    |
Screen SCK      ->  52  --|


GAMEPLAY:

We have created a game similar to the popular Flash game, "Bowman". The goal of the game
is to shoot the opponent at the opposite side of the playing field. You cannot see the
opponent's exact position at first; you must guess where he is and adjust the power and 
angle of your shot in order to hit him. 

The playing field is a total of 3 screen lengths, and the player can only see one at a time.
Player 1 is always on field 3, and Player 2 is always on field 1. Player 1 always has the first turn.
When the pushbutton is pressed, the player fires his ball. The screen will follow the ball as long as 
it is active. Once the ball has reached the opponent's field, you will be able to see his exact
position. It will then be the opponent's turn. 

In a Player vs. Player match, the joystick, pushbutton, and potentiometer are shared. You must
alternate from Player-to-Player. Both Players can see each others' shots. In a Player vs. Computer 
match, the computer will automatically fire regardless of your input (you will be able to see it's shot).



CONTROLS:

- Moving the joystick up and down will adjust the angle of your shot. The vector on the screen
  will adjust with the joystick for visual verification.
  
- Turning the potentiometer will adjust the power of the shot. There is a meter at the top of the
  screen representing the power. The power increases with the number of white bars.
  
- To shoot, press the pushbutton.



EXTRA INFO:

- Shooting upwards will result in an end to the turn. The fields above the Player have not been defined.

- The red ticks at the top-right corner of the screen define the field number. When there are 3 red ticks,
  it is Player 1's turn, and when there is 1 red tick, it is Player 2's turn.
  
- If you press the joystick mid-way through the game, you can see the numerical values for the
  power and angle of the shot.
  
- There is a glitch that can randomly occur where a Player spawns right at the edge of his field, and
  half of his body is unseen (he can still shoot). If this happens, the Player cannot be hit, and therefore
  has unlimited attempts to kill his opponent.
